    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Before I made this chicken breast recipe I had never cooked with cilantro. This is a great way to start. Now I am not afraid of sprinkling it into tacos, or any Mexican type of dish. This is also great to have for leftovers.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li> Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add rice and cook until golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer toasted rice to a bowl. </li>
    </ol>
